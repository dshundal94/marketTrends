# marketTrends
This repository shows market trends and certain insights for real estate in the San Joaquin Area. I have exported data from a local metrolist
and used it to showcase certain market trends since 2008. I could not access data from the time period before this because it has been archived. 
To see more of what I'm doing, please refer to the Jupyter Notebook.
