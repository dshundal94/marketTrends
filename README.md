# marketTrends
My main motivation in creating this repository was to get more comfortable with TimeSeries data as well as extract insights visually from plots and graphs.
This repository shows market trends and certain insights for real estate in the San Joaquin Area. I also forecast the market trends, in particular forecast the price
per square feet for a home over time. I have exported data from a local metrolist and used it to showcase certain market trends since 2008. I could not access data 
from the time period before this because it has been archived. To see more of what I'm doing, please refer to the Jupyter Notebook.
